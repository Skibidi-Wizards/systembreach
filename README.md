## ► Elevator Pitch

> You are a temporal agent, a ghost in the machine. Your mission: dive into corrupted timelines and shatter them from within. **SYSTEM BREACH** is a high-octane, first-person "speed-running" game where acrobatic movement is your only weapon. Navigate abstract, glitching levels, racing against a collapsing reality to purge the system before time, and reality itself, runs out.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🏃‍♂️ Acrobatic Speed-Running:** Master a fluid movement system. Wall-run, slide, dash, and double-jump your way through complex, non-linear environments.
* **🌀 Glitching Realities:** Explore abstract, surreal levels that visually distort and collapse around you as the clock ticks down. No two runs feel the same.
* **💥 Shatter the System:** The goal isn't just to be fast, it's to be precise. Hunt down and destroy "Temporal Anchors" to stabilize the timeline and unlock your escape.
* **🏆 Race for Ranks:** Compete against the clock and leaderboards. Earn ranks from Bronze to the coveted **Ghost** rank for near-perfect runs.
* **🎵 Pumping Synthwave Soundtrack:** Fuel your run with a high-energy electronic soundtrack that reacts to the intensity of your gameplay.

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Loop

The core of **SYSTEM BREACH** is built on a simple, addictive, and highly replayable loop.

1.  **Enter the Breach**
    * From the central Hub World, select a corrupted timeline ("Breach") to infiltrate. Each Breach has a unique layout, aesthetic, and difficulty.

2.  **Race the Clock**
    * As soon as you spawn, the countdown begins. The world around you begins to glitch and decay. You must move, and move *fast*.

3.  **Shatter the Anchors**
    * Your primary objective: find and destroy 3-5 **Temporal Anchors** hidden throughout the level. These are the keystones holding the corrupt timeline together.

4.  **Reach the Exit**
    * Once all Anchors are shattered, an exit portal materializes. Your final task is to navigate to the exit before the timer hits zero and the timeline collapses with you inside it.

5.  **Get Ranked**
    * Based on your final time, you are awarded a rank. This is your benchmark. Can you beat it? Can you achieve the **Ghost** rank?

| Rank  | Time Requirement (Example) |
| :---- | :------------------------- |
| 👻 **Ghost** | `< 0:45.00`                |
| 🥇 **Gold** | `< 1:00.00`                |
| 🥈 **Silver** | `< 1:30.00`                |
| 🥉 **Bronze** | `Finish`                   |
